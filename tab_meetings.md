**Location**: TBD  


## Past Presentations

### August 12, 2020 - Instrumentation Application Security Testing using the Java Sensor Toolkit (JST)

**Presenter**: Jeff Williams, Co-Founder/CTO, Contrast Security  
**Description**: Software is incredibly hard to secure because it's a  
black box. We've spent decades trying to verify properties of software  
by analyzing the source code, scanning, fuzzing, pentesting, etc...  The  
goal of "security observability" is to expose exactly what's going on  
inside an application while it's running.  In this talk, you'll learn  
how to use the free and open source Java Sensor Toolkit (JST) project  
to easily create your own powerful runtime instrumentation without  
coding. You can use JST to analyze security defenses, identify complex  
vulnerabilities, create custom sandboxes, and enforce policy at runtime.  
You can create your own IAST tests and your own RASP defenses.  Ultimately,  
security observability allows Dev, Sec, and Ops teams to work together in harmony,  
so you can focus on delivering value at high velocity.
